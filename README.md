# Enklare - jokes

To instal, run `npm i`, to serve run `npm run preview`

## A few words

I took some liberties within this project. As I'm a busy person and I made this in my free (and valuable) time, I allowed myself
to use NuxtJS to speed up the process of setting up things like typescript support, allowed myself usage of composables like `useFetch`.
This also meant that instead of using axios I used built-in fetching system. I also used a <a href="https://css-system-deploy.netlify.app/">
CSS framework</a>, albeit one written exclusively by me, exactly for opportunities like this one.
